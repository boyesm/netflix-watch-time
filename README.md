# Netflix Watch Time

## About

A static website built with Bootstrap and JS that analyzes your Netflix watch history and shows the user how much time they've spent watching Netflix (as well as some other stats).

Built around a neat feature that Netflix implemented that allows users to export all their watched shows in .csv format. The website imports this .csv, and pulls info on every title from The Movie Database (TMDB). Watch time is totalled as well as some other stats.
